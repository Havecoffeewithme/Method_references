"# Method_references" 

This project demonstrates the use of Java 8+ functional features such as:

Lambdas and method references

Functional interfaces (Predicate, Consumer, Runnable)

Processing collections with flexible filtering and actions

Components:

NoteBook: prints notes and greetings using lambdas and method references.

People: manages a list of Person objects and applies conditional logic for filtering and printing.

This project serves as a learning exercise in combining object-oriented programming with functional programming concepts in Java.
